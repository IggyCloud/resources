# Gemini Context: Performance & Observability Resources

This directory contains the testing, observability, and deployment resources for the `eShop` application located in the sibling `eShop` directory. It is the operational heart of the performance optimization project.

## Directory Structure & Purpose

- **`/k6`**: Contains performance testing scripts written for Grafana k6. These scripts define the load patterns and scenarios used to benchmark the application.
- **`/observability`**: Holds configurations for the observability stack, including Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, Loki for logging, and potentially other tools like Tempo for tracing.
- **`/evidence`**: Stores the raw results, logs, and comparative data from different performance tuning experiments. This is crucial for tracking progress and validating improvements.
- **`/scripts`**: A collection of shell scripts for automating tasks like deployment, database tuning, and environment setup.
- **`/k8s`**: Kubernetes manifests and configurations for deploying the `eShop` application and its supporting infrastructure.

## Project Goal

The resources in this directory are single-mindedly focused on supporting the primary project goal: maximizing the Requests Per Second (RPS) of the `eShop` application. All activities, from writing test scripts to configuring dashboards, serve this objective.

## Context: "A Software Engineering Journal"

This entire initiative is part of a public learning series on the **IggyCloud YouTube channel**. As an AI assistant, you should help manage and expand these resources to facilitate the ongoing performance engineering work. Your tasks may include creating new k6 scripts, modifying Grafana dashboard configurations, or analyzing the data stored in the `/evidence` directory.
